# Architecture

This document describes the implemented shared-service architecture for outback.
The binding decision and its consequences are recorded in
[ADR 0001](decisions/0001-shared-service-architecture.md).

## Product boundary

outback moves trusted, resource-heavy commands and Docker image builds away from developer
laptops and GitHub-hosted runners. It is project-aware, but it does not define a project
task language: repositories continue to own commands in Taskfiles, scripts, Makefiles, or
their CI configuration.

The core contract is deliberately small:

- Git semantics select the exact worktree input, including dirty and non-ignored untracked
  files.
- REAPI v2 Merkle trees, CAS, FindMissingBlobs, and ByteStream provide incremental content
  transfer.
- An OCI image defines the command environment; an argument vector, working directory,
  environment, timeout, exit code, stdout, and stderr define execution.
- Dockerfiles and native Buildx/BuildKit define image builds.
- Docker Swarm initially schedules trusted OCI jobs behind the service boundary.
- OpenTelemetry and JUnit are optional standard observability and test-result formats.

There are no language-specific runner types, generated preparation hooks, or
`.outback.json` suite definitions. A Dev Container adapter can be
added later if real consumers need it, but the Dev Container specification is not a CI
or remote-execution dependency.

Repository identity uses one deliberately small, non-secret `outback.json` containing only
the outback project slug. The CLI resolves an explicit flag, `OUTBACK_PROJECT`, or the nearest
link between the working directory and Git root, in that order. This supports nested
monorepos without turning the file into a task or environment specification.

```

The public control plane is a protobuf-defined API served with Connect over HTTPS. It owns
authentication, authorization, projects, admission, job identity, status, logs,
cancellation, scheduling decisions, credential issuance, and audit records. Clients never
receive Docker or Swarm credentials and never address a worker directly.
The stable v1 compatibility, idempotency, pagination, error, and reconnectable-log
semantics are specified in [Control API v1](control-api.md).

The data planes remain upstream protocols:

- CAS and ByteStream accept a short-lived, job-scoped mTLS identity.
- BuildKit accepts a short-lived, build-scoped client certificate. The CLI creates an
  ephemeral standard Buildx remote-driver record using `cacert`, `cert`, `key`, and
  `servername`, invokes Buildx unchanged, then removes the record.
- Swarm node certificates identify workers independently from users. Only the control
  plane can reach the Swarm manager API.

## Authentication and authorization

### Local clients

Each laptop receives its own named, revocable, opaque token for one user. Tokens may have
an expiry and are stored server-side only as a keyed digest. Compromise of one laptop does
not require rotating every user or CI credential.

An administrator enrolls a new laptop with a high-entropy code that expires within 30
minutes and locks after five failed attempts. `outback login` reads the code from a hidden
terminal prompt or stdin, exchanges it once for the ordinary per-device token, and stores
that durable token in the operating-system credential store. The durable token is never
placed in a command argument, repository file, or enrollment message. Browser OAuth can
be added later without changing the resulting device-token model.

Credential resolution is deterministic:

1. `--token`, for explicit automation and diagnostics;
2. `OUTBACK_TOKEN`;
3. the operating-system credential store populated by `outback login`;
4. GitHub OIDC exchange when the Actions identity variables are present.

A static token may authenticate a person to the control plane. It is never forwarded to
CAS, BuildKit, Docker, Swarm, or a worker.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions presents its OIDC JWT to an outback exchange endpoint with an exact outback
audience. The control plane validates the issuer, signature through GitHub's JWKS, audience,
expiry, not-before time, and an enabled project trust relationship.

Authorization uses immutable `repository_id` and `repository_owner_id` claims, plus the
configured workflow, ref, environment, and event policy. Repository names are metadata,
not identity. A successful exchange returns a short-lived project credential bounded to
the workflow job. A `pull_request` trust must name a protected GitHub environment because
the OIDC JWT does not contain an immutable head-repository ID. Environment approval is the
explicit trust gate; unapproved forks and other untrusted PRs never receive an outback
project session.

### Jobs and builds

After authorization, the control plane returns a stable job or build ID and only the
short-lived credentials needed for that operation. Job credentials are project- and
operation-scoped, expire quickly, and cannot create other jobs. Logs, status, cancellation,
and artifacts are authorized again by project rather than possession of a Docker identity.

The initial identity model has only four credential classes: user device tokens, GitHub
project trust relationships, job/build credentials, and worker identities. Organization
tokens, general service accounts, browser device flows, and complex roles are deferred
until a demonstrated consumer requires them.

The current protocol-transparent CAS gateway validates that the certificate names an
active job, but bazel-remote still uses one shared CAS namespace. It does not inspect
individual REAPI methods or enforce a project namespace within that active connection.
Because CAS digests are capabilities, this is acceptable only for the current mutually
trusted POC projects. Before onboarding projects that require confidentiality from each
other, add a gRPC-aware method/root authorizer or isolated per-project CAS namespaces.
The shared-cache contract is exercised with two independently authorized projects: the
second project transfers zero already-present CAS bytes and reuses a BuildKit layer while
retaining separate control-plane job/build records.

## Execution flow

1. The CLI resolves the Git root and project identity, then selects tracked and
   non-ignored untracked files with Git.
2. It asks the control plane to admit an arbitrary argument-vector command. The control
   plane resolves the project-owned active OCI digest unless an allowed explicit override
   was supplied, then records that immutable digest with resources and timeout.
3. The CLI uses its job-scoped credential to query CAS and upload only missing blobs.
4. The control plane creates a Swarm replicated job. The scheduler and Docker API remain
   private implementation details.
5. The worker materializes the CAS tree at an identical host/container path and executes
   the command directly in the project-selected, digest-pinned OCI image.
6. The control plane exposes reconnectable status and logs. Cancellation scales the job
   to zero; timeout terminates the process group and returns exit code 124.

Project runner images follow an intentionally small OCI lifecycle. A normal Dockerfile is
built and pushed through native Buildx/BuildKit; Buildx reports the manifest digest; the
control plane pulls and validates that digest before atomically activating it. The previous
digest remains available for rollback, and activation/rollback history is project-scoped.
Runner images contain toolchains and system dependencies, while worktree source continues
to arrive through CAS and writable dependency caches remain explicit worker state.

The server associates CAS roots, jobs, builds, logs, and audit events with a project.
Project identity replaces a managed server-side Git clone: CAS already provides
content-addressed incremental synchronization without clone drift or patch semantics.

## Testcontainers contract

Trusted test jobs may mount the worker Docker socket. The workspace is mounted at the same
absolute path on the host and inside the runner so sibling Testcontainers can bind project
files. Published ports are reachable from the runner, and Ryuk remains enabled for cleanup.

Docker access is root-equivalent host control, not an isolation boundary. The service only
accepts trusted repositories and trusted pull requests. Running untrusted code requires a
VM or equivalent strong sandbox per job and is a future architecture decision.

## Capacity and portability

Builds and commands share one SQLite-backed FIFO. Submission order is represented by a
monotonic database sequence, and exactly one row may hold the active worker lease. The
dispatcher admits the oldest queued operation and makes no priority, fairness, or resource
estimates. Queue and lease state survive a control-plane restart.
Active build leases have a configurable two-hour safety timeout so a client killed without
a cancellation request cannot block every later operation indefinitely.

The admitted operation receives the VM's available CPU and memory: Outback does not set
per-job Swarm reservations or limits, and BuildKit is not capped separately. A repository
that wants parallel work submits one command whose own Taskfile, Makefile, test runner, or
script runs tasks concurrently. This keeps project orchestration in the repository while
preventing unrelated dispatchers from oversubscribing the trusted single worker.

The initial deployment has one worker and therefore one active operation. A future worker
pool can assign the oldest queued operation to the next free worker without changing the
client contract or adding per-user scheduling controls.

The portable boundaries are Linux, Git, OCI, REAPI CAS/ByteStream, Dockerfiles,
Buildx/BuildKit, and HTTPS. Docker Swarm and the initial CAS implementation are replaceable
server internals. Hetzner is the current host, not a product dependency, and Terraform
remains the provisioning source of truth for dedicated infrastructure.

## Deliberately absent client paths

The CLI has one transport and execution contract: Connect/HTTPS to the shared service.
It has no direct Docker, Swarm, REAPI, CAS, BuildKit, worker, or SSH backend; those are
private server implementation details. It also has no shared bearer-token coordinator,
named suite/profile format, standard language runner, or source-build installation path.
SSH remains only in host deployment and break-glass operations.
