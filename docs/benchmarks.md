# Benchmarks

## Controlled comparison harness

`outback-benchmark` measures multiple argv-based candidates against one exact worktree.
The checked-in LeapView specifications live under `.outback/benchmarks/` and compare:

- native Docker Buildx, outback Buildx, and Depot for `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.site`;
- local Go and generic `outback exec` for the two focused Testcontainers workloads.

Every specification uses one excluded warmup followed by five serial measured runs. It
passes identical trailing build/test arguments to every candidate and requires a clean
source worktree. Test samples execute in new detached worktrees so ignored derived files
and mutations from an earlier candidate cannot influence a later one. Image samples stay
in the same read-only source worktree because changing local-context paths defeats the
cache identity used by BuildKit and does not represent normal repeated builds. The runner
records the Git commit and a content fingerprint, preserves a log for every run, and writes
median plus nearest-rank p95 to `summary.json`. An unavailable optional
candidate is labeled `unavailable`; it is never replaced with an estimate or an older
cross-commit measurement.

Run a specification from the `outback` module, choosing an untracked output directory:

```console
task benchmark:compare -- \
  --spec ../.outback/benchmarks/testcontainers-lifecycle.json \
  --output .tmp/benchmarks/testcontainers-lifecycle

DEPOT_PROJECT_ID=<project-id> task benchmark:compare -- \
  --spec ../.outback/benchmarks/production-image.json \
  --output .tmp/benchmarks/production-image
```

Image comparisons intentionally include `--load`, because both local development and
the current CI smoke tests consume the resulting image from the caller's Docker daemon.
The runner records end-to-end command latency. Provider-internal phase timing remains in
each raw log and must not be presented as a directly comparable metric unless all three
providers expose the same boundary.

The focused test specifications call repository-owned Taskfile workloads. Those tasks
force normal source generation before `go test` on both local and remote candidates.
outback itself has no LeapView preparation hook and ignored generated files are never added
to its generic source-transfer contract.

## Controlled provider result

The controlled run on 2026-08-02 used one excluded warmup and five serial measured runs.
Both candidates in each comparison used the same clean commit, source fingerprint,
Dockerfile arguments, platform, tag, and `--load` output contract.

| Workload | Candidate | Median | p95 | Measured values |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Generated Testcontainers lifecycle | local | 43.88 s | 44.46 s | 43.46, 44.19, 43.88, 44.46, 42.87 s |
| Generated Testcontainers lifecycle | outback | 72.90 s | 75.53 s | 71.13, 74.78, 72.90, 75.53, 72.51 s |
| Public site image | outback | 15.13 s | 16.90 s | 16.90, 15.13, 14.93, 14.62, 15.34 s |
| Public site image | Depot | 13.17 s | 199.45 s | 130.70, 199.45, 13.17, 7.88, 7.26 s |
| Production image | outback | 29.19 s | 30.34 s | 30.34, 29.19, 29.23, 28.82, 28.72 s |
| Production image | Depot | 31.00 s | 138.68 s | 138.68, 34.00, 31.00, 7.40, 7.80 s |

Every measured outback test run transferred `0 B` of source. The CPX32 was approximately
1.66 times slower than the laptop for the generated Testcontainers command, reflecting
the worker's 3.5-vCPU job reservation plus the remote boundary. The result still moves
the sustained CPU load off the laptop, which is the product objective.

outback's BuildKit cache was immediately stable after its excluded warmup. Depot produced
the fastest eventual hot image loads—about 7 to 8 seconds—but its first measured runs
continued rebuilding while cache state settled, creating high p95 values in this sample.
The production/site difference in outback (29 versus 15 seconds) indicates that native
remote Buildx `--load` remains sensitive to output image size. Depot's optimized load
path largely removes that cost once fully hot.

No local image median is reported. OrbStack repeatedly rebuilt the source-generation
layer for an unchanged commit instead of producing a valid warm hit, so the runs were
stopped rather than mislabeled as cached performance. During diagnosis, adding `**/.tmp`
to `.dockerignore` reduced the context from 304 MB to 108 MB, but the constrained local
builder still did not retain the expensive layer reliably.

The compact machine-readable evidence is
[`leapview-provider-comparison/summary.json`](../evidence/benchmarks/leapview-provider-comparison/summary.json).

## Hosted digest-push proof

The LeapView consumer then replaced trusted `--load` jobs with the standard registry
handoff documented in [Build, push, and smoke-test an immutable image](build-push-smoke.md).
GitHub Actions run [30742453481, attempt 2](https://github.com/flidai/leapview/actions/runs/30742453481)
reran the exact unchanged merge commit after the first complete run had populated the
cache. The remote builder pushed to GHCR, Buildx reported the immutable manifest digest,
and a separate Outback job exercised that exact digest on the worker.

| Workload | Warm build + push | Remote exact-digest check | Source upload | GitHub job |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Public site image | 11.96 s | 5.50 s smoke | 0 B | 62 s |
| Production runner image | 9.54 s | — | — | part of production job |
| Production application image | 13.41 s | 56.11 s full qualification | 0 B | 139 s |

The GitHub job duration includes checkout, tool installation, Buildx setup, registry
login, OIDC exchange, and post-job cleanup. The build column starts when Outback reports
the native Buildx backend and ends when the digest-addressed manifest push completes.
The production qualification includes image pull, smoke validation, API generation,
remote CLI compilation, Compose startup, and browser checks; it is intentionally broader
than a build benchmark.

This result removes the production image-size penalty seen in the earlier `--load`
comparison: the production build-and-push was 13.41 seconds instead of Outback's 29.19
second `--load` median. It is also below the earlier Depot 31.00 second median, while
Depot's final fully settled samples remained faster at roughly 7–8 seconds. The site
result was 11.96 seconds versus the earlier 15.13 second Outback and 13.17 second Depot
medians. These comparisons describe the observed runs, not a new five-sample
distribution; the committed evidence labels the hosted proof as a single warm repeat.

The exact runner digest from this proof was activated only after both image jobs passed.
A default-image verification reported Docker Compose v5.0.0 and completed in 1.665
seconds with `0 B` uploaded. The prior runner digest remains in the audited image history
for one-command rollback.

The machine-readable evidence is
[`leapview-digest-push-warm/summary.json`](../evidence/benchmarks/leapview-digest-push-warm/summary.json).

## Shared-service local proof

The generic service E2E on 2026-08-01 ran a project-selected pinned Go image through
Connect/HTTPS, job-scoped CAS mTLS, private Swarm scheduling, and Testcontainers. Its
repeat input upload was `0 B`; the final cached end-to-end sample was 2.800 seconds. A native
Buildx build then reached BuildKit through a separate build-scoped certificate and hit
its cached layer. The committed machine-readable result is
[`evidence/service-local/proof.json`](../evidence/service-local/proof.json); raw logs are
intentionally retained only as local operational output.

This is a functional boundary benchmark on the constrained local OrbStack VM, not a fair
capacity comparison with the developer laptop or CPX32. The CPX32 warm workload numbers
below remain the useful remote compute baseline.

## Shared-service CPX32 proof

The final generic service proof on the existing Hetzner CPX32 completed its warm run in
3.893 seconds with `0 B` uploaded; its preceding sample was 3.807 seconds. Testcontainers,
timeout, cancellation, capacity-aware queueing, and native BuildKit mTLS all passed. An
earlier first deployment sample uploaded only 590 bytes because the prior legacy
benchmarks had already populated most CAS/image content. The committed proof is
[`evidence/service/proof.json`](../evidence/service/proof.json).

## LeapView Testcontainers baseline

Measured on 2026-08-01 at LeapView merge commit
`23248fa0c4ebbef579b10f090a7ad26e7ccc67f3` using the existing Hetzner CPX32:

- worker: 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM;
- job reservation and limit: 2.5 vCPU, 5 GB RAM;
- one priming run excluded, followed by five serial measured runs;
- source snapshot: 1,921 files, 26.2 MiB;
- every measured run transferred `0 B` through CAS;
- `go test -count=1` forced the tests to execute while retaining dependency/build caches;
- pinned Docker and Testcontainers images were already present for measured runs.

| Workload | End-to-end median | End-to-end p95 | Remote median | outback boundary median |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MinIO Parquet refresh contract | 29.04 s | 29.70 s | 24.53 s | 4.51 s |
| Testcontainers qualification lifecycle | 21.91 s | 22.41 s | 17.42 s | 4.52 s |

“End-to-end” starts before source selection/CAS negotiation and stops after the CLI has
reported the terminal result. “Remote” is the Swarm task lifetime. “outback boundary” is
their difference and includes local input hashing, zero-byte CAS negotiation, SSH setup,
Swarm submission/status, and final result retrieval.

The committed five-run summaries are
[`leapview-minio-warm/summary.json`](../evidence/benchmarks/leapview-minio-warm/summary.json)
and
[`leapview-testcontainers-lifecycle-warm/summary.json`](../evidence/benchmarks/leapview-testcontainers-lifecycle-warm/summary.json).
Per-run logs are intentionally retained only as local operational output.

The benchmark does not report a cold-cache number. Source-generation and build-tag
configuration were corrected during initial setup, which seeded parts of CAS, Docker,
and Go caches. Clearing shared worker caches solely to manufacture a cold number would
disturb the useful POC state and is not necessary for the primary warm-cache decision.

## Findings

LeapView's build-only generated Go packages are intentionally gitignored. The benchmark
ran the normal source-generation step once and explicitly included those derived files in
the immutable input snapshot; generation time is outside the measurements. A production
LeapView suite must make that preparation reproducible without weakening Git ignore
semantics. The project OCI image supplies the toolchain, and a repository-owned command
such as `task test` performs generation and testing inside one remote job.

The first full qualification attempt also found that Debian Bookworm's `docker.io` CLI
only supported API 1.41, while the worker's Docker 29 daemon requires API 1.44 or newer.
The standard runner now copies the official digest-pinned Docker 29.1.3 CLI. After the
upgrade, the complete merged qualification lifecycle passed both its `docker-cli` and
`testcontainers` implementations remotely in one job.

The immediate performance target is the roughly 4.5-second outback boundary. It is stable
across both workloads and therefore worth profiling before buying a larger worker. More
CPU should reduce Go compilation and test execution, but it will not remove fixed SSH,
CAS negotiation, or Swarm lifecycle latency.

## LeapView canonical CI cutover

The final warm-cache cutover run executed the repository's unmodified `task ci` contract
on the existing CPX32 in 652.317 seconds (10m52.317s). CAS transferred `0 B`. This was not
a reduced benchmark: generation verification, browser and Go suites, Testcontainers,
vet, race checks, route QA, and both Terraform deployment validations all passed. The
runner reserved 3.5 vCPU and 6 GiB from the 4-vCPU/8-GiB worker.

The machine-readable result is
[`service/leapview-cutover.json`](../evidence/service/leapview-cutover.json), and the
operational cutover and rollback procedure is in
[`leapview-cutover.md`](leapview-cutover.md).
